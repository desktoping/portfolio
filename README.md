# PORTFOLIO
Purpose is to showcase my skills in developing software applications both backend and frontend

### Contents
The main page is inspired by an image taken from google search when searching for `software developer portfolio template` keyword.

### Code
Code is developed by hand - though I was templated to use AI to create the code for me; typical of a lazy programmer ðŸ˜°

### Copyright
I do not claim ownership of the template used, though the code is from my own imagination.
